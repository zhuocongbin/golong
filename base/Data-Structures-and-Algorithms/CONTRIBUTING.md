# Contributing Guide

Hi! Thanks for the interest in the project. Here are some notes if you want to make the project better ;)

#### I have a question
Clearly formulate your question and create an issue.

#### I have found a bug
Simply create a pull request and provide a detailed description of the problem.

#### I have a proposition for improvement
Create an issue if you have an idea or create a pull request if you know how to solve it in a source code.

#### I have made own implementation of algorithm or data structure
Unfortunately, we do not accept third-party implementations.

### General notes
- Make your code clean and clear.
- Make sure that your code passes the tests, otherwise, it will be rejected.
- Use labels to specify the type of issue or pull request.
