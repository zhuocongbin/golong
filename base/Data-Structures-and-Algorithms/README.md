## Usage

The library is not intended for direct use by importing. We strongly recommend copying the necessary implementations and adjusting to your case.

You can download the source using `go get` command:

```
go get github.com/floyernick/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
```

Don't forget about proverb:
> A little copying is better than a little dependency.
